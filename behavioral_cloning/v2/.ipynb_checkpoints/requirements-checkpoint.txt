# requirements.txt to enable memory-efficient BC training with GPU support
# using imitation library's DataLoader integration.

# --- Core Libraries ---
# Imitation library (requires stable-baselines3 and gymnasium)
# Version 1.0.0 and later generally support data_loader in BC.__init__
imitation==1.0.0

# Stable-Baselines3 (policy structure used by imitation)
# Version 2.x.x is compatible with imitation 1.x.x
stable-baselines3==2.2.1

# Gymnasium (standardized environment spaces)
# Compatible with recent SB3 and Imitation
gymnasium==0.29.1

# PyTorch (backend for neural networks)
# The version below is the standard CPU version.
# YOU MUST INSTALL THE CORRECT CUDA-ENABLED VERSION SEPARATELY AFTER INSTALLING OTHERS.
# See instructions below and on the PyTorch website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
torch==2.2.2

# --- Data Handling and Utilities ---
# HDF5 file handling
h5py==3.10.0

# Numerical operations, base for spaces and data
numpy==1.26.4

# Data splitting (train/test split)
scikit-learn==1.4.1

# Progress bar (often pulled by other libraries, but good to include)
tqdm==4.66.2
